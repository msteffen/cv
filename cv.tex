\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item\textbf{Engineering:} Written a significant amount of C++, Java, and Go professionally, and smaller projects in Typescript+React and Python. I am always excited to learn new languages and tools.
        \item\textbf{Management:} Managed up to five engineers and co-managed seven, and I have hired into backend and full-stack roles. I have strong written and verbal communication skills and wrote many of Pachyderm's internal templates, handbooks and guides.

    \textit{Software Engineering Manager}
\end{twocolentry}

\vspace{0.1 cm}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item Designated a Key Employee when Pachyderm was acquired by HPE in 2023.
        \item Continued managing the Pachyderm Integrations Team through May 2024, hiring a full-stack engineer and shipping a complete rewrite of our Jupyter extension to meet the security requirements of HPE's customers.
        \item Co-managed a team of seven engineers, after Pachyderm was re-organized into this single team in June 2024.
        \item Led several internal efficiency improvements, such as codifying our engineering standards and expectations in an engineering handbook and standardizing on a single common development environment, which I worked with IT to implement. This streamlined process helped the team ship several long-requested features.

    \textit{Software Engineering Manager}
\end{twocolentry}

\vspace{0.1 cm}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item Managed our Integrations Team starting in 2022, hiring a backend engineer onto the team (a backfill) and supported the team through the design, development, and initial release of our JupyterLab extension. I continued contributing to design reviews and going on call through my tenure as manager.
        \item This extension allowed data scientists to explore and consume Pachyderm data in a Jupyter notebook, and convert Jupyter notebooks into Pachyderm pipelines. Using it, they could develop Pachyderm pipelines interactively, which made the product much more accessible to new users, and made Pachyderm pipelines much easier to debug.
