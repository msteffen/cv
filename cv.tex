%%%%%%%%%%%%%% HPE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{twocolentry}{

    \textbf{Hewlett Packard Enterprise}

    \textit{Software Engineering Manager}
\end{twocolentry}

\vspace{0.10 cm}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item I was designated a Key Employee when Pachyderm was acquired by HPE in 2023.
        \item I continued supporting the Pachyderm Integrations Team as its Engineering Manager through May 2024, hiring a frontend engineer and shipping a complete rewrite of our Jupyter extension to meet the security requirements of HPE's customers.
        \item In June 2024, Pachyderm was reorganized into a single team with seven engineers and two managers. I stepped into the role of co-Engineering Manager for the new team, along with a colleague who was transitioning back to engineering.
        \item I led several internal efficiency improvements, such as codifying our engineering standards and expectations in an engineering handbook and standardizing on a single common development environment, which I worked with IT to implement. This streamlined process allowed the team to ship several long-requested features.
        \item I was laid off, along with most of the Pachyderm team, in Nov 2024.

\end{twocolentry}

\vspace{0.10 cm}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item In Jan 2022, I stepped into the role of Engineering Manager for our Integrations Team. I hired a backend engineer onto the team (a backfill) and supported the team through the design, development, and initial release of our JupyterLab extension.
        \item This extension allowed data scientists to explore and consume Pachyderm data in a Jupyter notebook, and convert Jupyter notebooks into Pachyderm pipelines. Using it, they could develop Pachyderm pipelines interactively, which made the product much more accessible to new users, and made Pachyderm pipelines much easier to debug.

    \textit{Software Engineer}
\end{twocolentry}

\vspace{0.10 cm}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item I implemented several major features (an authorization system and a complete rewrite of our pipeline controller, among others) as a core contributor.
        \item In 2019, we created a new Integrations Team with the mandate of building integrations between Pachyderm and other AI/ML products. I was the first member of the team and acted as tech lead through its growth to five engineers. I wrote our first integration, with Kubeflow, and supported an overhaul of that initial Kubeflow integration as well as new integrations with AzureML, Sagemaker, Seldon, Spark, and MLFlow.

\begin{onecolentry}
    \begin{highlights}
        \item I independently maintained a legacy authorization service used by Google Docs, Photos, YouTube, Search, and other products through 2012.
        \item In 2013, I joined the \href{https://research.google/pubs/zanzibar-googles-consistent-global-authorization-system/}{Zanzibar} as the fourth engineer. I migrated products and internal infrastructure from the legacy service to Zanzibar and implemented features and performance improvements in Zanzibar itself.

\section{Skills}

\begin{onecolentry}
    \textbf{Engineering:} As a backend engineer, I have written a significant amount of C++, Java, and Go in a professional capacity. I've also done smaller projects in Typescript+React and Python.

    \textbf{Management:} I have supported teams of up to five engineers and hired into frontend and full-stack roles. I have strong written and verbal communication skills and wrote many of Pachyderm's internal templates and guides.
